# gesture-tinyml
Embedded machine learning for gesture recognition using Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. Includes source code for programming the board and notebooks for training the model.

## Objectives

## File/Folder Structure
Shown below are what each file and folder contains.
- `serial_logger.py` - Used to copy the output from the Arduino Serial Monitor to a CSV since manual copying cannot be done successfully.
-  `data` - This folder contains the CSV datafiles captured by the Nano 33 BLE Sense using the `serial_logger.py` Python script.

## TODO
- Jupyter Notebook contains a cell which gives an error. Fix it. Shape mismatch.
